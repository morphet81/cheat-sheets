Run pre-push checks to ensure code quality before pushing to remote.

**Usage:**
- `/pre-push` - Run all pre-push checks for the current project

**Instructions:**

1. **Check for npm pre-push script:**
   - Look for `package.json` in the current directory
   - If found, check if it has a `pre-push` script in the `scripts` section
   - If the script exists, run `npm run pre-push` and report the results
   - If successful, inform the user and STOP here

2. **If no pre-push script exists, auto-detect and run checks in parallel:**

   a. **Identify project type:**
      - Check for `package.json` (Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript project)
      - Check for `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `requirements.txt` (Python project)
      - Check for `Cargo.toml` (Rust project)
      - Check for `go.mod` (Go project)
      - Check for other language-specific files

   b. **Detect available checks** (linting, tests, build) for the project type. Then **run independent checks in parallel** using the `Task` tool (`subagent_type: general-purpose`) with `run_in_background: true`:
      - Spawn one agent per independent check category (e.g., linting agent, test agent, build agent)
      - Checks that don't depend on each other should run concurrently — typically linting and tests are independent, while build may depend on type-checking

   c. **Linting checks:**
      - **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript:**
        - Check for ESLint: `eslint` in package.json scripts or `.eslintrc*` file
        - Check for Prettier: `prettier` in package.json scripts or `.prettierrc*` file
        - Check for TypeScript: `tsc` in package.json scripts or `tsconfig.json` file
        - Run: `npm run lint` or `npx eslint .` or `npm run type-check` or `npx tsc --noEmit`

      - **Python:**
        - Check for: `pylint`, `flake8`, `black`, `mypy`, `ruff`
        - Run available linters (e.g., `pylint src/`, `flake8 .`, `black --check .`, `mypy .`)

      - **Rust:**
        - Run: `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy`

      - **Go:**
        - Run: `go fmt ./...` and `golint ./...` or `go vet ./...`

   d. **Test checks:**
      - **Node.js:** Check for test scripts in package.json
        - Run: `npm test` or `npm run test:ci` (if available)

      - **Python:**
        - Check for: `pytest`, `unittest`, `nose2`
        - Run: `pytest` or `python -m pytest` or `python -m unittest discover`

      - **Rust:**
        - Run: `cargo test`

      - **Go:**
        - Run: `go test ./...`

   e. **Build checks:**
      - If applicable, try building the project to ensure no compilation errors
      - **Node.js:** `npm run build` (if script exists)
      - **Rust:** `cargo build`
      - **Go:** `go build ./...`

3. **Report results:**
   - Wait for all parallel agents to complete and aggregate their results
   - Provide a clear summary of all checks performed
   - Report pass/fail status for each check
   - If any checks fail, show the errors and suggest fixes
   - Include the commands that were run for transparency
   - If all checks pass, confirm the code is ready to push

4. **Handle edge cases:**
   - If no tests or linting tools are detected, warn the user and ask if they want to proceed without checks
   - If commands fail due to missing dependencies, suggest installation commands
   - If in a monorepo or workspace, detect and handle appropriately

**Example output format:**

```
## Pre-Push Checks

### Linting
ESLint passed
Prettier check passed
TypeScript compilation passed

### Testing
All tests passed (24 tests, 0 failures)

### Build
Build successful

---

All pre-push checks passed! Code is ready to push.

Commands run:
- npm run lint
- npm test
- npm run build
```

**On failure:**

```
## Pre-Push Checks

### Linting
ESLint failed

Error in src/components/Button.tsx:
  15:7  error  'onClick' is missing in props validation  react/prop-types

### Testing
All tests passed

---

Pre-push checks failed. Please fix the issues above before pushing.
