# Project Rules

## Skills

- Skills are stored in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` in this repository.
- When creating, modifying, or deleting a skill, **always** update `claude-skills.html` to reflect the change. The HTML page documents all available skills with their descriptions, usage instructions, and raw file content.
- Follow the existing skill card structure in `claude-skills.html` (skill-card div with header, description, usage, collapsible raw content).
